# ChatBot

This is a frequently used Chat Bot that trains on questions and answers. It takes in new questions and attempts to map it to an already learnined question. If it finds one, it gives the answer mapped to that question. 

It also has a GUI that can be improved upon plus a speech interface to take in spoken words through the microphone. 

In any case part of this code is used in any capacity, please reference the owners: Joseph Aribido and Girija Godbole.

Thanks,
-Joseph
